# Portfolio Page

This is a portfolio page for a full stack developer built using React and Vite. The page showcases the developer's projects and skills, as well as provides a way for potential clients or employers to contact them.

## Installation

To install the project, you can use npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Usage

To start the development server, run:
  
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  # or
  yarn dev
  ```
This will start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`, where you can preview the portfolio page and make changes.

To build the project for production, run:
  
  ```bash
  npm run build
  # or
  yarn build
  ```

  This will generate a production-ready build of the portfolio page that can be deployed to a web server.
